## Molecular Docking
Molecular docking is a **computational technique** used to _predict_ the conformation and energy of interaction between a _small molecule (ligand)_ and a **macromolecule (receptor, e.g. protein).** Its **main** objective is to _predict_ the optimal conformation of the **ligand-receptor complex** with the _highest_ possible affinity, for which it is necessary to _optimize_ the ligand molecule in order to obtain information about the physical and chemical properties of the molecule, such as its **three-dimensional geometry, potential energy and electronic distribution**, in short, it mainly seeks to _improve_ its ability to form complexes with biomolecules. This **goal** is achieved by modifying its structure to _maximize_ favorable interactions with the target receptor; for example, optimizations can be made to **increase** the affinity of the ligand for a specific protein and thus improve its catalytic activity. This information is fundamental to understanding how molecules **interact** in a system, which is critical in fields as diverse as **computational chemistry**, **drug design**, and **protein-ligand** molecular docking assays.

| Used for to design ligands, such as PTT, since there is no 3D information about it, and to optimize existing ligands. | Used for to use mathematical algorithms, such as the Lamarckian algorithm, which allows us to add Gasteiger Charges to predict the Gibbs Free energy to be released by the system, in case of protein-ligand affinity. |
