## Mathematical Modeling of Genetic Expression
As a first deliverable in Mathematical Modeling, we decided to develop a Python code that allows us to clarify the behavior of the system proposed in the project, relying on mathematics to solve the behavior of the system once active, to finally obtain the enzyme activity.
