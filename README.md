Fashion and Fitness, who doesn't love these trends? But, are we aware of the problems they may cause? 
In FCB-UANL we reflect on the environmental problems implied by fast fashion and how SynBio can act on it before it's too late.

**Mathematical Modeling Committee** formed by:
- Dulio Leonardo Ortiz Esparza. Committee Leader.
